The timestepping routine is contained in full_dynamics.py.

Figure notebooks should generate the Figures from .npy or .npz files, which are available on request. The Figure notebooks themselves often (but not always) contain the code used to generate these data, which is commented out so that the Figure notebooks run quickly.

Code is not commented, but should be self explanatory in the context of the accompanying paper.

Contact njbg2@cam.ac.uk for questions about code, and to access the data.
