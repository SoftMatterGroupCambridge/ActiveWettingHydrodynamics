The timestepping routine is contained in full_dynamics.py.

Figure notebooks should generate the Figures from .npy or .npz files, which are available on request. The Figure notebooks themselves often (but not always) contain the code used to generate these data, which is commented out so that the Figure notebooks run quickly.

Code is not commented, but should be self explanatory in the context of the accompanying paper.

Contact njbg2@cam.ac.uk for questions about code, and to access the data.
Large data files are not included due to size restrictions in the repository. These correspond to:
full_to_partial_wetting.npz
partial_to_full_wetting.npz
FW_history.npy
PW_history.npy
linear_instability.npz
These files can be provided upon request to the above email, or generated again using the code included.
